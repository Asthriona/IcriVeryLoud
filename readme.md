# I cry Very Loud
## THIS REPO DO NOT REFLECT ON MY USUAL CODE QUALITY (it's a bit better when i take time.)
This is a todo list I made in some kind of "speed code" stuff
Link to the video soon.   
It's actually just a speedup video of me coding.  
The code is hella crappy, I made it in less than an hours and making this made me cry.  
please dont hurt me.  
  
## You can use it as todo list if youwant. I dont mind.  
Install:  
Get a linux server or cloud thinggy who care?  
then install nodejs (read nodejs docs I'm lazy rn.)

``` npm i ```  
then start it.   
``` npm run dev```  
for autorestart on change or for production  
``` npm start ```  
There ya go have fun,  
dont blame me if ppl abuse of it. It's very random and lazy.
